This set of tutorials is designed to introduce the python programming language.
It is aimed at people who have very little experience with python, or with
programming in general. The tutorials are organised in order of increasing
difficulty, but feel free to jump about their order. Tutorials have been
tagged by their contents, and can be searched by those on the 'Tags' page.


## Using these resources 

There are lots of code examples in these tutorials. To ensure you understand
what each part of the code is doing, run the code on your own system and then
try modifying it until you are happy with how each part works.

There is a set of **Problems** at the end of each tutorial. Each problem set
contains a number of functions along with a description of what each function
should do, e.g:


~~~ python
    def say_hello(name):
        """
        This function should print out "Hello, John", where the name John
        is given by the argument name.
        >>> say_hello("Rocket")
        Hello, Rocket
        >>> say_hello("Peter Quill")
        Hello, Peter Quill
        """

        return
~~~

The function docstring tells you what the function should do, along with
some examples of what the output should be, when the function is run.
